# dating-app
_(just for fun)_
The sake of creating {} is for me to hone my skills as a new programmer. This is my first ever personal project and I wanted to make it as a way showcase what I've learned as a first year Comp Sci major.

To whoever is reading this, thank you for stopping by :)

# What is {_insert tbd dating app name_}?
  {} is a personal project of mine. Using concepts from popular dating apps, {} is pretty much the same thing.  
  Except, instead of connecting with real people, you connect with 1's and 0's.
  
# Wait, what?
  Yep, this is no ordinary dating app. Think of {} like an advanced chat bot with:  
  - Fun ASCII profile pictures ;-P
  - Randomly generated bios made love (or not!)
  - Conversation point system
  - And more!  

It's just as authentic as the people on real dating apps!

# How {''} works.
  That is a **great** question!
