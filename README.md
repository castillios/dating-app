# dating-app
_(just for fun)_
The sake of creating PenPal is for me to hone my skills as a new programmer. This is my first ever personal project and I wanted to make it as a way showcase what I'm learning as a first year Comp Sci major.

_(So far this README is incomplete as I'm trying to flesh out the concept a bit more.)_

To whoever is reading this, thank you for stopping by! :)

# What is PenPal?
  Written entirely in Python, PenPal is a personal project of mine. Using concepts from popular dating apps, PenPal is pretty much the same thing.  
  Except, instead of connecting with real people, you connect with 1's and 0's.
  
# Wait, what?
  Yep, this is no ordinary dating app. Think of PenPal as an advanced chat bot with:  
  - Fun ASCII profile pictures ;-P
  - Randomly generated bios made love (or not!)
  - Conversation point system
  - And more!  

It's just as authentic as the people on real dating apps!

# How PenPal works.
  That is a **great** question!
